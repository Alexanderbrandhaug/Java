Created this project in the course of TDT4100(Objectoriented programming) in the spring of 2021. 
I've learned a tons, and I would most likely keep working on this project once I get some spare time. I want to add a DB to store all the bookings, and perhaps play with some API's for the sake of learning.
Mind that the design of the GUI was not a part of the project, hence I spent very little time on that part. 


For a demo of the App, you can take a quick look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uspo46p4cq8
